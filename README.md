# Statistical Calculations ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project reads data from a file and computes two important statistical metrics: Linear Regression Line and Pearson Correlation Coefficient.


## Features ðŸŒŸ


- **Linear Regression Line**: Calculates the best-fit line that minimizes squared differences between line numbers (x-axis) and actual values (y-axis).
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**: Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between line numbers and actual values.

## Usage/Examples

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://learn.reboot01.com/git/mohani/linear-stats.git
   cd linear-stats
   ```
2. **Run test file followed by this program**
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh << will do the work for you
    ```
